Great job with your proposal!

Your tag game sounds like a lot of fun! Consider creating a TUI using
something like ncurses as x-forwarding for graphical interfaces can be
very laggy!  Alternatively, one could use a web interface (as long as
the web interface doesn't do all the concurrency for you).
